Command-line Python-based trading application for trading Bitcoins for other
currencies.  Supports MtGox and TradeHill exchangers.  It can generate simple
market depth charts.

Config file is $HOME/.trade and is in INI-like format. There is a global
section at the top, followed by configuration "profiles".  Program is invoked
with the profile name as the first argument. The configuration that is loaded
is the global section, plus any additions/overrides in the profile section.

If more command-line arguments are given, the program will execute them as a
command and then exit, without prompting the user for anything.

The dependencies for this program are the `python-openssl' and
`python-matplotlib' packages.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
=====================

default
	The default currency pair.  First is the "asset" and second is the
	"currency".  Prices appear as currency/asset.  (example: BTC USD)

digest
	The digest of the server's SSL certificate in the usual hexadecimal
	FF:FF:FF:FF format.  The program requires that a digest is given.
	Otherwise it won't connect.  It will fail if the server presents a
	certificate with a different digest.
digest.type
	The type of the digest.  (default: "sha1")

class
	MtGox or TradeHill.  Must be specified.
host
	Hostname of server to connect to.  (default is class-specific)
port
	Port to connect to.  (default: 443)
username
password
apitoken
	Credentials to give to server.

proxy.host
proxy.port
proxy.type
	Proxy to use to connect to server.  Type can be "socks4a" or "http".

websocket
	Whether to connect to MtGox's websocket interface.  (default is off)
websocket.proxy.host
websocket.proxy.port
websocket.proxy.type
	Proxy to use for the websocket.  Defaults to the above proxy setting.

websocket.initdelay
	Delay in seconds before websocket thread attempts to connect (so we
	avoid connects when invoked with single command).
websocket.depth.resync
websocket.tradesalways

safety
	Program will refuse doing trades while this is set.
fee
	Fee rate in percent units (0-100).  (example: 0.6)
fee.A.C
	Fee rate for when giving A and receiving C, in percent units.
fee.A.C.currency
	Either A or C.  Which balance the fee is subtracted from.  The default
	is MtGox-style (i.e. subtract from the money that you are receiving).
	TradeHill-style is to subtract from the currency that is not BTC.


COMMANDS
========

exit
quit
	Exits program.  Also, the usual Ctrl-D.

config PROFILE
	Switches the configuration profile at run-time to PROFILE.

default A C
	Switches the default currency pair to (A C).

ticker [A [C]]
	Basic ticker.  Only buy and sell price.

alarm BMIN BMAX SMIN SMAX [INTERVAL_SEC [SUCCESS_COND [BEEPS]]]
	Repeatedly poll for the current price every INTERVAL_SEC seconds and
	beep if best bid price goes below BMIN (condition 1) or above BMAX
	(condition 2) or best ask price goes below SMIN (condition 3) or above
	SMAX (condition 4).

	If the condition that triggered the beeps is equal to SUCCESS_COND, the
	command (or program) will end with exit status 0.

getdepth [raw]
	Dumps the current order book data in JSON format.  The "raw" option is
	only for MtGox and TradeHill and makes sure to return the exact same
	data the server gives.

d[epth] [v VOL] [n NUM] [A [C]]
	Displays order book data for the default pair or for (A C).  "v" is how
	far in the depth to display for both bids and asks (stops when the sum
	of orders in A becomes larger than VOL and displays the last order).

chart NAME [A [C]] FNOUT FNIN
	Makes a chart according to configuration options chart.NAME and
	chart.NAME.* .  "chart.NAME" option must be "PMIN PMAX PSTEP X YMAX",
	where PMIN is price at left edge, PMAX is price at right edge and PSTEP
	is the width of the bars in price units, YMAX is the y-range of the
	chart in asset units.  X and anything following YMAX is ignored.

	chart.NAME.sigma is the standard deviation value for the smooth orders
	plot.  Order book can be seen as a combination of deltas.  The "smooth
	orders plot" is the convolution with a gaussian, to show the general
	areas where there is concentration of bid/ask volume (purple) or number
	of bid/ask orders (green).

	chart.NAME.tstep is the tick interval in the price (horizontal) axis.

	Chart parameters are chart.NAME.X, but if missing, they default to
	chart.default.X .

	FNOUT is the image output filename.  Output format is PNG.  If missing,
	ImageMagick is used to display the image on the X screen.

	FNIN is the order book input filename.  Input format is MtGox JSON
	order book.  If missing, the server is queried.

trades [COUNT]
	Shows the last COUNT trades or as many as the server returns, for
	default pair.

funds [A [C]]
	Shows your balances for pair (A C) or the default pair.

value [A [C]]
	Shows the amount of A you would have if you gave all your C in exchange
	for A at market prie and the amount of C you would have if you gave all
	your A in exchange for C at market prices.

orders
	Shows your current orders.

c[ancel] [all|ID]
	Cancels either all orders or the order with the specified ID.

calc {b|buy|s|sell} ...
	Calculates the fees and rates you'd get if you bought at a particular
	price (if price is specified) or if you bought at market.

buy AMOUNT [ASSET] [at PRICE [CURRENCY]]
sell AMOUNT [ASSET] [at PRICE [CURRENCY]]
	Buy or sell at specified price.  If price is not specified, buys/sells
	at market (executes multiple orders).
